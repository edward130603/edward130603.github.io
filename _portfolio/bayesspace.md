BayesSpace is a R/Bioconductor package that contains a suite of tools for clustering and enhancing the resolution of spatial gene expression experiments. BayesSpace clusters a low-dimensional representation of the gene expression matrix, incorporating a spatial prior to encourage neighboring spots to cluster together. The method can enhance the resolution of the low-dimensional representation into "sub-spots", for which features such as gene expression or cell type composition can be imputed.
