Pro-inflammatory caspases play a role in sensing and responding to infection. The goal of the current study is to better understand the importance of caspases 1, 4, and 5 in humans and caspases 1 and 11 in mice in responding to infection by Salmonella. Experiments were conducted comparing bacterial abundance in wild-type and caspase-knockout human untransformed cells, human transformed cells, and mouse untransformed cells using confocal and fluorescence microscopy 7 hours after exposure to Salmonella. The statistical analyses account for the replicate study design and use appropriate data distribution models. The analyses also address issues of censoring and truncation that arise in some experiments.
